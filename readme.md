# Stashpedia Discord Bot
Use .stash <pop name here> to use

This is just as straight forward as my eBay bot, so I'm just going to copy and paste what I have from it before for the rest of this readme.md

If you do decide to use this on your Discord server, I request that you don't remove my name from the script itself :) It helps others for support when adding it to their server! Also, the clout. The fucking clout.
  
### How to install and use
1. Make sure you install [Python3.6.6](https://www.python.org/getit/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) followed by running the following in the same directory as stashpedia.py
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Get your Discord server [token](https://github.com/Chikachi/DiscordIntegration/wiki/How-to-get-a-token-and-channel-ID-for-Discord) and set permissions while you're at it
3. Use your favorite text editor to add the token to the script
4. Run script
```bash
python stashpedia.py
```
For Windows, google please.

## Future features:
* Use bot.commands so that you can extend the use of it to multiple sources - slowly realizing this isn't really needed.
